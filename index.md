# Introduction

Cinema is so much more than just entertainment. It’s a mirror (albeit sometimes a distorted one) of our society, its norms, its values… and, unfortunately, its inequalities. Since its early days, women on screen haven’t always had the spotlight: often confined to secondary or stereotypical roles, they’ve long remained in the shadows of male characters.

But things are changing, right ? Or maybe not so much ? That’s exactly what we’re here to explore. We’ll dive into how women are represented in films: Are there more female roles today ? Are they better written ? Are modern movies truly more “feminist,” or is that just a trendy buzzword ?

To find out, we’re going to dig into the data. We’ll count actresses, see if they outshine their male counterparts, analyze film themes, and even measure how many pass the famous Bechdel test. We’ll also tackle more specific questions: Do films from certain countries or genres do better than others ? Do feminist blockbusters even exist ?

And, because it’s always fun, we’ll try to answer the big question: What exactly makes a “feminist film” ? By exploring the data, we hope to find answers… or maybe even uncover new questions.

So, buckle up for a journey through the history of cinema and what it reveals (or doesn't) about the role of women on screen.

To dive into these questions, we have access to data on over 80,000 films, covering details like release year, country of production, genre, plots, actor information, and much more.

# General Analysis

## Proportion of actresses over time

To ease into things, we'll start by finding the average number of actresses and actors per year and per movie. It's not the most exciting part but hey, we've got to start somewhere...

{% include_relative assets/plots/nb_actors.html %}

Each curve shows the average number of male and female actors per movie. Although the number of female actors per movie seems to have increased over the year, it remains lower than the number of male actors on average since 1900 (there are on average twice as many male actors on screen as female actors).

Now, looking at the female-to-male ratio among actors in the top five movie-producing countries since 1920, the picture isn't great for women with the ratio usually staying below 1. Some big swings in the early decades can reflect the social and economic changes of the time. Since the 1960s, things start to level off at quite a low ratio and unfortunately, there's been no real progress since. There is some variation across countries with for example France and the UK that occasionnally have slightly better ratios than the US and India. Overall, this graph paints a picture of slow, uneven progress when it comess to the representation of women in global cinema.

But maybe this ratio swings in favor of actresses depending on the genre of the movie ! Let's take a look at the gender repartition for different genders.

Well... actresses are still in the minority, no matter the genre or the era !
